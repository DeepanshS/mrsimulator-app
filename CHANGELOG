- Made more changes to the user interface.
- Added drag and drop experimental data directly on to the simulation card.
- Attached the reference offset and spectral width to the plot x-axis drag and zoom
  handle. Users may now drag along the x-axis to set the reference-offset. Similarly,
  zooming in or out along the x-axis with set the spectral width. Note, simultaneous
  zooming along both axes will not trigger a reference-offset or spectral width update.
- For security reasons, we have removed markdown rendering of external links from the
  user input file. Users may still provide the link in the description of the isotopomer
  file, which will be displayed as text.
- Added isotopomers, spectrum, and decompose icons.
- Isotopomers' example is no longer a separate display on the secondary navbar. The
  isotopomers example is now a part of the isotopomers tab from the secondary navbar.
