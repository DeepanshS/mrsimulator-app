Upcoming additions and changes
==============================

What's new!
-----------

**General**

- Updates to the UI.
- A new menubar with File, Isotopomer, Method options.
- Two-column view on larger devices. The left column shows the parameters, while the
  right column shows the graph update.

**Method**

- Add multiple method objects to the simulation.
- Each method object can hold an experiment. Compare the simulation from each method with an experiment
- Selection of various method types (BlochDecaySpectrum, BlochDecayCentralTransitionSpectrum)
- Interactive selection of methods and graph update.
- Ability to export simulation on per method base.
- Easy duplicate, clear, and remove methods from the app
- Use search to filter the list of methods.

**Spin System**

- Add multiple spin-systems to the simulation.
- Interactively select the spin system from the spectrum.
- Easy duplicate, clear, and remove spin systems from the app.
- Add spin systems by import data from the file.
- Use search to filter the list of spin systems.

**Examples**

- Choose from pre-defined examples. Both spin 1/2 and quadrupolar.


v0.1.0
======

- Made more changes to the user interface.
- Added drag and drop experimental data directly on to the simulation card.
- Attached the reference offset and spectral width to the plot x-axis drag and zoom
  handle. Users may now drag along the x-axis to set the reference-offset. Similarly,
  zooming in or out along the x-axis with set the spectral width. Note, simultaneous
  zooming along both axes will not trigger a reference-offset or spectral width update.
- For security reasons, we have removed markdown rendering of external links from the
  user input file. Users may still provide the link in the description of the isotopomer
  file, which will be displayed as text.
- Added isotopomers, spectrum, and decompose icons.
- Isotopomers' example is no longer a separate display on the secondary navbar. The
  isotopomers example is now a part of the isotopomers tab from the secondary navbar.


- Added Lorentzian and Gaussian line-broadening
- Changes to the user-interface
- Added options for underlaying the spectrum to compare with the simulation.


- Added dimension and environment interface
